# Merrill's algorithm functions and subroutines

This repository hosts code files for an implementation of Merrill's algorithm which solves an Arrow-Debrue type economic equilibrium.

The file MerrillJulia.jl creates a function for the programming language Julia. This is a dynamic language that can achieve very fast speeds.

The file MerrillFortran.f90 creases a subroutine for use in a Fortran environment. Fortran code can be compilied using the simply Fortran complier available from approximatrix.
